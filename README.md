WinBtrfs v1.6
-------------

WinBtrfs is a Windows driver for the next-generation Linux filesystem Btrfs.
A reimplementation from scratch, it contains no code from the Linux kernel,
and should work on any version from Windows XP onwards. It is also included
as part of the free operating system [ReactOS](https://www.reactos.org/).

If your Btrfs filesystem is on a MD software RAID device created by Linux, you
will also need [WinMD](https://github.com/maharmstone/winmd) to get this to appear
under Windows.

First, a disclaimer:

You use this software at your own risk. I take no responsibility for any damage
it may do to your filesystem. It ought to be suitable for day-to-day use, but
make sure you take backups anyway.

Everything here is released under the GNU Lesser General Public Licence (LGPL);
see the file LICENCE for more info. You are encouraged to play about with the
source code as you will, and I'd appreciate a note (mark@harmstone.com) if you
come up with anything nifty.

See at the end of this document for copyright details of third-party code that's
included here.

Donations
---------

I've been developing this driver for fun, and in the hopes that someone out there
will find it useful. But if you want to provide some pecuniary encouragement, it'd
be very much appreciated:

Installation
------------

To install the driver, [download and extract the latest release](https://github.com/maharmstone/btrfs/releases),
right-click btrfs.inf, and choose Install. The driver is signed, so should work out
of the box on modern versions of Windows.

For the very latest versions of Windows 10, Microsoft introduced more onerous
requirements for signing, which are only available to corporations and not individuals.
If this affects you (i.e. you get a signing error when trying to install the driver),
try disabling Secure Boot in your BIOS settings.

There's also a [Chocolatey package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/winbtrfs) available -
if you have Chocolatey installed, try running `choco install winbtrfs`.

Uninstalling
------------

If you want to uninstall, from a command prompt run:

```
RUNDLL32.EXE SETUPAPI.DLL,InstallHinfSection DefaultUninstall 132 btrfs.inf
```

You may need to give the full path to btrfs.inf.

You can also go to Device Manager, find "Btrfs controller" under
"Storage volumes", right click and choose "Uninstall". Tick the checkbox to
uninstall the driver as well, and let Windows reboot itself.

If you need to uninstall via the registry, open regedit and set the value of
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\btrfs\Start to 4, to disable the service.
After you reboot, you can then delete the btrfs key and remove
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\btrfs.sys.

Compilation
-----------

You will need Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 if you want to compile the driver; you might
be able to get earlier versions to work with a bit of work.

You'll also need a copy of the Windows DDK; I placed mine in C:\WinDDK. If yours
is somewhere else, you'll need to edit the project settings. You'll also need to
edit the post-build steps for the 64-bit versions, which are set up to
self-sign using my own certificate.

Mappings
--------

The user mappings are stored in the registry key
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\btrfs\Mappings. Create a DWORD with the
name of your Windows SID (e.g. S-1-5-21-1379886684-2432464051-424789967-1001),
and the value of your Linux uid (e.g. 1000). It will take effect next time the
driver is loaded.

You can find your current SID by running `wmic useraccount get name,sid`.

Similarly, the group mappings are stored in under GroupMappings. The default
entry maps Windows' Users group to gid 100, which is usually "users" on Linux.
You can also specify user SIDs here to force files created by a user to belong
to a certain group. The setgid flag also works as on Linux.

LXSS ("Ubuntu on Windows" / "Windows Subsystem for Linux")
----------------------------------------------------------

The driver will passthrough Linux metadata to recent versions of LXSS, but you
will have to let Windows that you wish to do this. From a Bash prompt on Windows,
edit `/etc/wsl.conf` to look like the following:

```
[automount]
enabled = true
options = "metadata"
mountFsTab = false
```

It will then take effect next time you open a new command prompt. Yes, you should
be able to chroot into an actual Linux installation, if you wish.

Commands
--------

The DLL file shellbtrfs.dll provides the GUI interface, but it can also be used
with rundll32.exe to carry out some tasks from the command line, which may be
useful if you wish to schedule something to run periodically.

Bear in mind that rundll32 provides no mechanism to return any error codes, so
any of these commands may fail silently.

* `rundll32.exe shellbtrfs.dll,CreateSubvol <path>`

* `rundll32.exe shellbtrfs.dll,CreateSnapshot <source> <destination>`

* `rundll32.exe shellbtrfs.dll,ReflinkCopy <source> <destination>`
This also accepts wildcards, and any number of source files.

The following commands need various privileges, and so must be run as Administrator
to work:

* `rundll32.exe shellbtrfs.dll,SendSubvol <source> [-p <parent>] [-c <clone subvol>] <stream file>`
The -p and -c flags are as `btrfs send` on Linux. You can specify any number of
clone subvolumes.

* `rundll32.exe shellbtrfs.dll,RecvSubvol <stream file> <destination>`

* `rundll32.exe shellbtrfs.dll,StartScrub <drive>`

* `rundll32.exe shellbtrfs.dll,StopScrub <drive>`

Troubleshooting
---------------

* The filenames are weird!
or
* I get strange errors on certain files or directories!

The driver assumes that all filenames are encoded in UTF-8. This should be the
default on most setups nowadays - if you're not using UTF-8, it's probably worth
looking into converting your files.

* The root of the drive isn't case-sensitive in LXSS

This is something Microsoft hardcoded into LXSS, presumably to stop people hosing
their systems by running `mkdir /mnt/c/WiNdOwS`.

* How do I change the drive letter?

With the shell extension installed, right-click the drive in Explorer, click Properties,
and go to the Btrfs tab. There should be a button which allows you to change the drive
letter.

* How do I format a partition as Btrfs?

Use the included command line program mkbtrfs.exe. We can't add Btrfs to Windows' own
dialog box, unfortunately, as its list of filesystems has been hardcoded. You can also
run `format /fs:btrfs`, if you don't need to set any Btrfs-specific options.

* I can't reformat a mounted Btrfs filesystem

If Windows' Format dialog box refuses to appear, try running format.com with the /fs
flag, e.g. `format /fs:ntfs D:`.

* I can't mount a Synology NAS

Synology seems to use LVM for its block devices. Until somebody writes an LVM driver
for Windows, you're out of luck.

* I can't mount a Thecus NAS

Thecus uses Linux's MD raid for its block devices. You will need to install [WinMD](https://github.com/maharmstone/winmd)
as well.

* The drive doesn't show up

On very old versions of Windows (XP, Server 2003?), Windows ignores Linux partitions
entirely. If this is the case for you, try running `fdisk` on Linux and changing your
partition type from 83 to 7.

Debug log
---------

WinBtrfs has three levels of debug messages: errors and FIXMEs, warnings, and traces.
The release version of the driver only displays the errors and FIXMEs, which it logs
via `DbgPrint`. You can view these messages via the Microsoft program DebugView, available
at https://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/debugview.

If you want to report a problem, it'd be of great help if you could also attach a full
debug log. To do this, you will need to use the debug versions of the drivers; copy the files
in Debug\x64 or Debug\x86 into x64 or x86. You will also need to set the registry entries in
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\btrfs:

* `DebugLogLevel` (DWORD): 0 for no messages, 1 for errors and FIXMEs, 2 for warnings also,
and 3 for absolutely everything, including traces.
* `LogDevice` (string, optional): the serial device you want to output to, such as
`\Device\Serial0`. This is probably only useful on virtual machines.
* `LogFile` (string, optional): the file you wish to output to, if `LogDevice` isn't set.
Bear in mind this is a kernel filename, so you'll have to prefix it with "\\??\\" (e.g.,
"\\??\\C:\\btrfs.log"). It probably goes without saying, but don't store this on a volume the
driver itself is using, or you'll cause an infinite loop.

Mount options
-------------

The driver will create subkeys in the registry under HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\btrfs
for each mounted filesystem, named after its UUID. If you're unsure which UUID refers to which
volume, you can check using `btrfs fi show` on Linux. You can add per-volume mount options to this
subkey, which will take effect on reboot. If a value is set in the key above this, it will use this
by default.

* `Ignore` (DWORD): set this to 1 to tell the driver not to attempt loading this filesystem. With the
`Readonly flag, this is probably redundant.

* `Readonly` (DWORD): set this to 1 to tell the driver not to allow writing to this volume. This is
the equivalent of the `ro` flag on Linux.

* `Compress` (DWORD): set this to 1 to tell the driver to write files as compressed by default. This is
the equivalent of the `compress` flag on Linux.

* `CompressForce` (DWORD): set this to 1 to force compression, i.e. to ignore the `nocompress` inode
flag and even attempt compression of incompressible files. This isn't a good idea, but is the equivalent
of the `compress-force` flag on Linux.

* `CompressType` (DWORD): set this to 1 to prefer zlib compression, 2 to prefer lzo compression, or 3
to prefer zstd compression. The default is 0, which uses zstd or lzo compression if the incompat flags
are set, and zlib otherwise.

* `FlushInterval` (DWORD): the interval in seconds between metadata flushes. The default is 30, as on Linux -
the parameter is called `commit` there.

* `ZlibLevel` (DWORD): a number between -1 and 9, which determines how much CPU time is spent trying to
compress files. You might want to fiddle with this if you have a fast CPU but a slow disk, or vice versa.
The default is 3, which is the hard-coded value on Linux.

* `MaxInline` (DWORD): the maximum size that will be allowed for "inline" files, i.e. those stored in the
metadata. The default is 2048, which is also the default on modern versions of Linux - the parameter is
called `max_inline` there. It will be clipped to the maximum value, which unless you've changed your node
size will be a shade under 16 KB.

* `SubvolId` (QWORD): the ID of the subvolume that we will attempt to mount as the root. If it doesn't
exist, this parameter will be silently ignored. The subvolume ID can be found on the inode property
sheet; it's in hex there, as opposed to decimal on the Linux tools. The default is whatever has been set
via `btrfs subvolume set-default`; or, failing that, subvolume 5. The equivalent parameter on Linux is
called `subvolid`.

* `SkipBalance` (DWORD): set to 1 to tell the driver not to attempt resuming a balance which was running
when the system last powered down. The default is 0. The equivalent parameter on Linux is `skip_balance`.

* `NoPNP` (DWORD): useful for debugging only, this forces any volumes to appear rather than exposing them
via the usual Plug and Play method.

* `ZstdLevel` (DWORD): Zstd compression level, default 3.

* `NoTrim` (DWORD): set this to 1 to disable TRIM support.

* `NoRootDir` (DWORD): if you have changed your default subvolume, either natively or by a registry option,
there will be a hidden directory called $Root which points to where the root would normally be. Set this
value to 1 to prevent this appearing.
