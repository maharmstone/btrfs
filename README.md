WinBtrfs v1.0
-------------

WinBtrfs is a Windows driver for the next-generation Linux filesystem Btrfs.
A reimplementation from scratch, it contains no code from the Linux kernel,
and should work on any version from Windows 7 onwards.
First, a disclaimer:

This software is in active development - YOU USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. I take NO
RESPONSIBILITY for any damage it may do to your filesystem. DO NOT USE THIS
DRIVER UNLESS YOU HAVE FULL AND UP-TO-DATE BACKUPS OF ALL YOUR DATA. Do not rely
on Btrfs' internal mechanisms: SNAPSHOTS ARE NOT BACKUPS, AND DO NOT RULE OUT
THE POSSIBILITY OF SILENT CORRUPTION.

In other words, assume that the driver is going to corrupt your entire
filesystem, and you'll be pleasantly surprised when it doesn't.

However, having said that, it ought to be suitable for day-to-day use.

Everything here is released under the GNU Lesser General Public Licence (LGPL);
see the file LICENCE for more info. You are encouraged to play about with the
source code as you will, and I'd appreciate a note (mark@harmstone.com) if you
come up with anything nifty. On top of that, I'm open to relicensing the code if
you've a burning desire to use it on a GPL or commercial project, or what have
you - drop me a line and we'll talk.

included here.

Installation
------------

The driver is self-signed at the moment, meaning that if you're using a 64-bit
version of Windows you'll have to tell it to boot up in Test Mode if you want it
to work. To do this, launch an admin command prompt (right-click on "Command
Prompt" and click "Run as administrator"), and run the following command:

    bcdedit -set TESTSIGNING ON

Reboot, and you should see "Test Mode" on the bottom right of the Desktop. You may
need to disable "Secure Boot" in BIOS for this to work.

To install the driver, [download and extract the latest release](https://github.com/maharmstone/btrfs/releases),
right-click btrfs.inf, and choose Install.

Uninstalling
------------

If you want to uninstall, go to Device Manager, find "Btrfs controller" under
"Storage volumes", right click and choose "Uninstall". Tick the checkbox to
uninstall the driver as well, and let Windows reboot itself.

If you need to uninstall via the registry, open regedit and set the value of
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\btrfs\Start to 4, to disable the service.
After you reboot, you can then delete the btrfs key and remove
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\btrfs.sys.

Compilation
-----------

You will need Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 if you want to compile the driver; you might
be able to get earlier versions to work with a bit of work.

You'll also need a copy of the Windows DDK; I placed mine in C:\WinDDK. If yours
is somewhere else, you'll need to edit the project settings. You'll also need to
edit the post-build steps for the 64-bit versions, which are set up to
self-sign using my own certificate.

Mappings
--------

The user mappings are stored in the registry key
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\btrfs\Mappings. Create a DWORD with the
name of your Windows SID (e.g. S-1-5-21-1379886684-2432464051-424789967-1001),
and the value of your Linux uid (e.g. 1000). It will take effect next time the
driver is loaded.

You can find your current SID by running `wmic useraccount get name,sid`.

Similarly, the group mappings are stored in under GroupMappings. The default
entry maps Windows' Users group to gid 100, which is usually "users" on Linux.
You can also specify user SIDs here to force files created by a user to belong
to a certain group. The setgid flag also works as on Linux.

Commands
--------

The DLL file shellbtrfs.dll provides the GUI interface, but it can also be used
with rundll32.exe to carry out some tasks from the command line, which may be
useful if you wish to schedule something to run periodically.

Bear in mind that rundll32 provides no mechanism to return any error codes, so
any of these commands may fail silently.

* `rundll32.exe shellbtrfs.dll,CreateSubvol <path>`

* `rundll32.exe shellbtrfs.dll,CreateSnapshot <source> <destination>`

* `rundll32.exe shellbtrfs.dll,ReflinkCopy <source> <destination>`
This also accepts wildcards, and any number of source files.

The following commands need various privileges, and so must be run as Administrator
to work:

* `rundll32.exe shellbtrfs.dll,SendSubvol <source> [-p <parent>] [-c <clone subvol>] <stream file>`
The -p and -c flags are as `btrfs send` on Linux. You can specify any number of
clone subvolumes.

* `rundll32.exe shellbtrfs.dll,RecvSubvol <stream file> <destination>`

* `rundll32.exe shellbtrfs.dll,StartScrub <drive>`

* `rundll32.exe shellbtrfs.dll,StopScrub <drive>`

Troubleshooting
---------------

* My drive doesn't show up!

If you're on 64-bit Windows, check that you're running in Test Mode ("Test Mode" appears
in the bottom right of the Desktop).

* My drive is readonly

Check that you've not got the new free space cache enabled, which isn't yet supported.

* The filenames are weird!
or
* I get strange errors on certain files or directories!

The driver assumes that all filenames are encoded in UTF-8. This should be the
default on most setups nowadays - if you're not using UTF-8, it's probably worth
looking into converting your files.

* `btrfs check` reports errors in the extent tree

There's a bug in btrfs-progs v4.7, which causes it to return false positives when
using prealloc extents - this'll also manifest itself with filesystems from the
official driver. If you still get the same errors when using btrfs-check v4.6, please
e-mail me what it says.

* The root of the drive isn't case-sensitive in LXSS

This is something Microsoft hardcoded into LXSS, presumably to stop people hosing
their systems by running `mkdir /mnt/c/WiNdOwS`.

* Disk Management doesn't work properly, e.g. unable to change drive letter

Try changing the type of your partition in Linux. For MBR partitions, this should be
type 7 in `fdisk`. For GPT partitions, this should be type 6 in `fdisk` ("Microsoft
basic data"), or 0700 in `gdisk`. We have to do some chicanery to get Linux partitions
to appear in the first place, but unfortunately this confuses diskmgmt.msc too much.

* How do I format a partition as Btrfs?

Use the included command line program mkbtrfs.exe. We can't add Btrfs to Windows' own
dialog box, unfortunately, as its list of filesystems has been hardcoded. You can also
run `format /fs:btrfs`, if you don't need to set any Btrfs-specific options.

* I can't reformat a mounted Btrfs filesystem

If Windows' Format dialog box refuses to appear, try running format.com with the /fs
flag, e.g. `format /fs:ntfs D:`.

Debug log
---------

WinBtrfs has three levels of debug messages: errors and FIXMEs, warnings, and traces.
The release version of the driver only displays the errors and FIXMEs, which it logs
via `DbgPrint`. You can view these messages via the Microsoft program DebugView, available
at https://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/debugview.

If you want to report a problem, it'd be of great help if you could also attach a full
debug log. To do this, you will need to use the debug versions of the drivers; copy the files
in Debug\x64 or Debug\x86 into x64 or x86. You will also need to set the registry entries in
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\btrfs:

* `DebugLogLevel` (DWORD): 0 for no messages, 1 for errors and FIXMEs, 2 for warnings also,
and 3 for absolutely everything, including traces.
* `LogDevice` (string, optional): the serial device you want to output to, such as
`\Device\Serial0`. This is probably only useful on virtual machines.
* `LogFile` (string, optional): the file you wish to output to, if `LogDevice` isn't set.
Bear in mind this is a kernel filename, so you'll have to prefix it with "\\??\\" (e.g.,
"\\??\\C:\\btrfs.log"). It probably goes without saying, but don't store this on a volume the
driver itself is using, or you'll cause an infinite loop.

Mount options
-------------

The driver will create subkeys in the registry under HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\btrfs
for each mounted filesystem, named after its UUID. If you're unsure which UUID refers to which
volume, you can check using `btrfs fi show` on Linux. You can add per-volume mount options to this
subkey, which will take effect on reboot. If a value is set in the key above this, it will use this
by default.

* `Ignore` (DWORD): set this to 1 to tell the driver not to attempt loading this filesystem. With the
`Readonly flag, this is probably redundant.

* `Readonly` (DWORD): set this to 1 to tell the driver not to allow writing to this volume. This is
the equivalent of the `ro` flag on Linux.

* `Compress` (DWORD): set this to 1 to tell the driver to write files as compressed by default. This is
the equivalent of the `compress` flag on Linux.

* `CompressForce` (DWORD): set this to 1 to force compression, i.e. to ignore the `nocompress` inode
flag and even attempt compression of incompressible files. This isn't a good idea, but is the equivalent
of the `compress-force` flag on Linux.

* `CompressType` (DWORD): set this to 1 to prefer zlib compression, and 2 to prefer lzo compression. The
default is 0, which uses lzo compression if the incompat flag is set, and zlib otherwise.

* `FlushInterval` (DWORD): the interval in seconds between metadata flushes. The default is 30, as on Linux -
the parameter is called `commit` there.

* `ZlibLevel` (DWORD): a number between -1 and 9, which determines how much CPU time is spent trying to
compress files. You might want to fiddle with this if you have a fast CPU but a slow disk, or vice versa.
The default is 3, which is the hard-coded value on Linux.

* `MaxInline` (DWORD): the maximum size that will be allowed for "inline" files, i.e. those stored in the
metadata. The default is 2048, which is also the default on modern versions of Linux - the parameter is
called `max_inline` there. It will be clipped to the maximum value, which unless you've changed your node
size will be a shade under 16 KB.

* `SubvolId` (QWORD): the ID of the subvolume that we will attempt to mount as the root. If it doesn't
exist, this parameter will be silently ignored. The subvolume ID can be found on the inode property
sheet; it's in hex there, as opposed to decimal on the Linux tools. The default is whatever has been set
via `btrfs subvolume set-default`; or, failing that, subvolume 5. The equivalent parameter on Linux is
called `subvolid`.

* `SkipBalance` (DWORD): set to 1 to tell the driver not to attempt resuming a balance which was running
when the system last powered down. The default is 0. The equivalent parameter on Linux is `skip_balance`.

* `NoPNP` (DWORD): useful for debugging only, this forces any volumes to appear rather than exposing them
via the usual Plug and Play method.
