# Preventing Btrfs driver loading during system booting, or unistall Btrfs driver (in some cases) that causes (in some cases)  contained system BSOD.

Maybe you want to unistall the driver without entering to the OS which installed it. 
(Such as, there are errors in a Btrfs part. This can cause Windows BSOD, show blue or green screen, very quick after desktop appears-- at least on WinBtrfs v1.9.)
(So, it is sometimes necessary to prevent Btrfs driver loading during system booting.)

You can switch to another OS, open regedit as admin. (Of course avaible in Windows PE, or is it also avaible in Linux?) 
Press win+r, then type "regedit", press Enter.

Such as, load regedit of target OS to HKLM(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE) as name "sys", and it is in part P, as I did.
(Switch to regedit.) Press HKLM, Alt+F, Alt+L ï¼ˆto load configuration unit), then switch folder directory to "P:\Windows\System32\config\", find and choose the file "system".
(P:\Windows\System32\config\system)
(If your target system is in other part, please change part letter to yours. Such as, P:\Windows\System32\config\ -> D:\Windows\System32\config\ .)
(But do this before, please make sure mount the part including the target OS as read-write able. Such as you need to care about, the OS is in VHD/VHDX, is as RAMOS or ghost/shadow OS.)
Name it as "sys".(Need, or you need to modify the text copied from below.)

Now, copy five lines below to an empty text(notepad) file, and save it as an reg file(such as"Btrfs_driver-stop.reg")(ANSI encoding method is ok.).

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\sys\ControlSet001\Services\btrfs]
"Start"=dword:00000004

---

Double click the file, press Alt+Y, to continue import it to regedit.

Now, you can switch to regedit, press "sys", Alt+F, Alt+U, Alt+Y, to unmount the regedit "system" of target OS. 
(Remember to unmount VHD/VHDX if it exists. ) 

Now it is done preventing Btrfs driver loading in system booting.
Restart the computer, switch to the target OS, then you can delete the btrfs key and remove C:\Windows\System32\drivers\btrfs.sys, unistalling the btrfs driver.

(For more, there is more options for mounting. You can get in much farther down to get, <a href="/README.me/#Mount">Mount</a> options .)
